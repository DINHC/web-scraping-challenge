      - The process required creating a ipynb that would go through various websites related to mars and gather news titles, pictures, and facts then converting that to a .py file 
        called scrape.py
      
      - The scrape.py file was made to run through and gather only the printed recent news article, paragraph, images, facts, and hemisphere images
      
      - Once that was done a app.py was created to reference a index.html and the scrape.py

      - An index.html was then created to shape how the site is suppose to look like. With a main scrape button at the top with the various images placed together with the news           title/paragraph and facts underneath
